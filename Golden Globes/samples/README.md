This folder contains a number of small samples of the corput for testing purposes. These samples were generated using the sampler.py script in the modules file.

The format of the file names is: [base]\_[detail]\_[id]\_[lines] where  
  [base] is the name of the original corpus,  
  [detail] is a number from 1-3 signifying the size of each JSON object in the file,  
  [id] is a unique number, and  
  [lines] is the number of JSON objects in the sample.

random_sample.txt is just a human-readable text file with a random sample of ~800 tweets.
